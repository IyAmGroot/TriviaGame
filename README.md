# TriviaGame

This is the Game of Thrones trivia game.  

The goal is to answer as many questions as you can correctly.  At the end of the game you will see the number of questions answered correctly, incorrectly, and left blank.  Players have 10 seconds to answer each question.  Players who score less than nine (9) will see one message at the end, scoring nine (9) or higher will show a different message.

Once the game has completed and judgement has been passed on the user, the user may click the "Play Again?" button to restart the game.

This project is important because it is the preeminant form of testing your GoT skills.  Players scoring a 15 out of 15 should probably get a hobby.  

There is no help available.  Users are on their own.  Play at your own peril!

Eric Finney maintains this project.   Players wishing to comment on the game are free to contact someone else (instructors and TAs excepted of course!).
